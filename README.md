Diligent software engineer with 4+ years of experience in product-based software development. My experience ranges from working full-time for a startup with less than ten employees to fortune 500 companies like Samsung R&D. Currently working as a senior software developer at redBus (MakeMyTrip). The world's largest online booking platform with a global customer base of more than 23 million.

I am passionate about computer science and its application. I am a skilled Mobile developer with knowledge of backend engineering. I am a quick learner and a team worker that gets the job done. I can easily capitalize on low-hanging fruits and quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas.
